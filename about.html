    <p>
        I am Carlos Miguel Lazaro, an amateur graphic designer and avid Pokémon fan. The vast majority of my portfolio is inspired by Pokémon, and I never would have reached my current skill level if not for it and the people I've met through this niche little interest. I am also currenntly studying for my BS Information Technology course, as well as performing volunteer writing and contribution work online!
